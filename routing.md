### Types of Routing in Django REST Framework

Django REST Framework (DRF) provides multiple ways to define URL routing for API projects, enabling efficient URL management. You can use traditional routing or leverage advanced techniques to save development time. This guide will cover both methods for defining routes in DRF.

#### 1. **Basic Function-Based Routing**
Function-based views (FBVs) can be mapped to specific API endpoints using the `path` function from the `django.urls` module. Here's how to define a simple route:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('books', views.books),
]
```

This maps the `books` view from `views.py` to the `/api/books` endpoint.

To handle specific HTTP methods, you can use the `@api_view` decorator:

```python
@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
```

#### 2. **Class Method Routing**
To map a specific method within a class, declare the method as a `@staticmethod` and use it in the `urls.py` file.

**views.py:**

```python
class Orders:
    @staticmethod
    @api_view(['GET'])
    def listOrders(request):
        return Response({'message': 'List of orders'}, status=200)
```

**urls.py:**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('orders', views.Orders.listOrders),
]
```

#### 3. **Class-Based View (CBV) Routing**
In DRF, you can map class-based views (CBVs) directly to URL patterns, saving time by not having to manually define HTTP method handling.

**views.py:**

```python
class BookView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, pk):
        return Response({"message": "Single book with ID " + str(pk)}, status=200)

    def put(self, request, pk):
        return Response({"title": request.data.get('title')}, status=200)
```

**urls.py:**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('books/<int:pk>', views.BookView.as_view()),
]
```

With this setup, you can access `/api/books/{bookId}` with both `GET` and `PUT` methods. If the class includes other methods like `post()`, `delete()`, or `patch()`, it will automatically support those HTTP methods.

#### 4. **ViewSet Routing**
Classes extending `viewsets.ViewSet` can manage multiple HTTP methods in one place, making your code cleaner.

**views.py:**

```python
class BookView(viewsets.ViewSet):
    def list(self, request):
        return Response({"message": "All books"}, status=200)

    def create(self, request):
        return Response({"message": "Creating a book"}, status=201)

    def retrieve(self, request, pk=None):
        return Response({"message": "Displaying a book"}, status=200)

    def update(self, request, pk=None):
        return Response({"message": "Updating a book"}, status=200)

    def partial_update(self, request, pk=None):
        return Response({"message": "Partial update"}, status=200)
```

**urls.py:**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('books', views.BookView.as_view({'get': 'list', 'post': 'create'})),
    path('books/<int:pk>', views.BookView.as_view({'get': 'retrieve', 'put': 'update'})),
]
```

This setup allows accessing:
- `GET /api/books` for listing all books.
- `POST /api/books` for creating a new book.
- `GET /api/books/{pk}` for retrieving a specific book.
- `PUT /api/books/{pk}` for updating a book.

#### 5. **Routing with SimpleRouter**
When using `viewsets`, you can simplify URL patterns using DRF's `SimpleRouter`, which eliminates the need to manually define routes for different HTTP methods.

**urls.py:**

```python
from rest_framework.routers import SimpleRouter
from . import views

router = SimpleRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register('books', views.BookView, basename='books')

urlpatterns = router.urls
```

This approach automatically maps:
- `GET` and `POST` requests to `/api/books`.
- `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests to `/api/books/{id}`.

The `trailing_slash=False` argument ensures that the URLs donâ€™t have a trailing slash.

#### 6. **Routing with DefaultRouter**
`DefaultRouter` works similarly to `SimpleRouter` but offers an additional benefit: it creates an API root view that lists all registered endpoints.

**urls.py:**

```python
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from . import views

router = DefaultRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register('books', views.BookView, basename='books')

urlpatterns = router.urls
```

With this setup, you can access the API root at `/api/`, where all available API endpoints will be listed.

### Conclusion
In Django REST Framework, routing can be done in multiple ways, from basic function-based views to sophisticated class-based routing with `viewsets` and routers like `SimpleRouter` and `DefaultRouter`. These techniques allow you to design efficient, scalable, and clean URL mapping for your API projects.
